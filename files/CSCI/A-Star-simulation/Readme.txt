This webpage was created to show how A* pathing works. To run just open the index.html file
To run the simulator:
1) Get a grid (either use a grid.txt file, create your own grid, or create a random grid)
2) Click translate to draw the grid
3) Choose a Heuristic and searching algorithm
4) Choose a speed (if you leave it at 0 (very left), it will not move, instead you have to click the step button)
5) Watch your simulaton!
-)You can view a game version of the algorithm by clicking the 'gamify' button
-)if you set the speed to 0, you can step through the algorithm

The required files are: index.html & astar.js
Grid files are: grid.txt, grid2.txt, grid3.txt
The sprite sheet is: pixels.png

Screenshots are explained as follows:
-random.png: Showing the random grid option

-gamify2.png: Showing the start (pacman) move to the end
-path.png: showing the path highlighted after finding the end
-step.png: showing a single step in the algorithm
